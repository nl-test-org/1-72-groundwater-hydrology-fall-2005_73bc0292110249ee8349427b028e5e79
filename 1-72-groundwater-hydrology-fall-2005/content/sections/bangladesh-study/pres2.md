description: These materials are from a case study and field trip recently undertaken
  in Bangladesh. Starting in 2002, the MIT research program has combined hydrogeologic
  modeling with detailed field and laboratory experiments to test theories of arsenic
  mobilization and transport. Experimentation with subsurface cores and field manipulation
  of aquifer chemistry has revealed that arsenic is held immobile through a complex
  system of biogeochemical processes. Harvey?s group is now developing numerical simulation
  tools to manage the groundwater and agricultural systems that couple groundwater
  flow with biogeochemical reactions.
